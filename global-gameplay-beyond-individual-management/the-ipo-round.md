# The IPO Round

In addition to the weekly macroeconomic votes that shape the world, we present the ultimate stage to test your courage and capitalâ€”the permanent, recurring 24-hour IPO Round. This is a high-risk, high-reward competitive arena, operating independently from your regular production and management activities.

**â€¢ Game Rules: The 24-Hour Wealth Rush**

1. **Countdown:** Each round has a strict 24-hour upper limit.
2. **Overtime:** Every time a share is purchased, the timer increases by 10 seconds (maximum 120 seconds per purchase), but it will never exceed the 24-hour hard cap.
3. **Low-Second Protection:** If a purchase is made within the final 2 seconds, the timer resets to 3 seconds, ensuring a fair window for final moves.
4. **32-Tier Price Ladder:** The share price increases according to a 32-tier pricing table based on the total number of shares sold in the round. The later you join, the higher the cost.
   * **Price Formula:** Price of Tier \*n\* = \*n\* Ã— 1,000 $CASH per share (where \*n\* ranges from 1 to 32).

**â€¢ Massive Rewards: A Feast for Winners and Participants**\
When the timer hits zero, the prize pool is distributed as follows:

1. **ðŸ‘‘ Final Winner: 55%!** â€“ The last player to successfully purchase a share claims the largest portion of the pool.
2. **All Shareholders: 30%!** â€“ Every player who purchased shares in the round shares 30% of the pool, proportional to their holdings.
3. **Ecosystem Contribution: 15% â€“ 10%** funds project development, and 5% is seeded directly into the next round's prize pool.

**â€¢ Built-in Deflation:**\
10% of the $CASH used for each IPO share purchase is permanently burned and does not enter the prize pool, directly enhancing the value of $CASH.
