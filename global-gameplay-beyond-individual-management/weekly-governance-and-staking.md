# Weekly Governance & Staking

Your personal earnings are determined not only by your facility levels but also, and more directly, by the **macroeconomic policies of the "District" you belong to. The architects of these policies are all players, including you.**

More importantly, the capital you commit to shaping the world itself generates a continuous stream of passive income for you.

**• Six Districts, Six Economies:**\
The game world is divided into six independent economic zones. Each district has two core parameters—its "wealth code"—determined by weekly community votes, with values set within specific ranges:

&#x20;       **Base Productivity:** 85% \~ 130% – Directly affects the gross profit of all land within the district.

&#x20;       **Base Tax Rate:** 1% \~ 18% – Directly impacts the final net income of all players in the district.

**• Default Parameters for the Launch Week:**

|         District        | Base Productivity | Base Tax Rate |                      Initial Positioning                     |
| :---------------------: | :---------------: | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|   **Central District**  |        100%       |       8%      |                   Balanced, newbie-friendly                  |
|    **Tech District**    |        120%       |      14%      |         High output, high tax; high risk, high reward        |
|  **Financial District** |        110%       |      10%      |                      Stable, consistent                      |
| **Industrial District** |        95%        |       5%      |       Low tax, long shifts; suited for mass production       |
|   **Coastal District**  |        100%       |      12%      | Balanced attributes; subsequent fluctuations depend on votes |
|  **Cultural District**  |        105%       |       6%      |   Medium output, low tax; ideal for early-game snowballing   |

**• Your Vote is Also Your "Savings Account":**\
To gain voting rights, you must **stake** your $CASH (locked for 7 days). This not only grants you the power to change the world's rules but also allows you to automatically share in the ecosystem's growth rewards.

&#x20;       **Power:** The amount you stake directly determines your voting weight in the weekly decisions that set the productivity and tax rates for all six districts.

&#x20;       **Rewards:** As long as your assets remain staked, you will continuously earn $CASH staking rewards every second. These rewards come from an official $CASH reward pool, regularly funded to incentivize long-term believers in the ecosystem.

**• Weekly Schedule:**\
Voting concludes every **Sunday at 23:59 UTC**. New parameters take effect at **Monday 00:00 UTC** and remain active for the entire week.
