# A Step-by-Step Tutorial

Assume you've just acquired your initial startup capital in $CASH, either through the public sale or from an exchange.

* **Step 1: Purchase Your First Plot of Land (Recommendation)**
  * **Target:** An **Apartment** for **1,000 $CASH**.
  * **Why:** It's the lowest-cost entry point, allowing you to reserve more initial capital for staff and facilities.
* **Step 2: Recruit Your Core Team**
  * **Target:** Hire **10-20 staff members** (100 $CASH/person).
  * **Why:** This is sufficient to run your starter plot at or near full capacity, maximizing your early-game efficiency.
* **Recommended Starting Budget:**
  * 1,000 $CASH (Land) + 1,000\~2,000 $CASH (Staff) + Cash flow for several wage cycles + 0.1 MON (First facility unlock fee).
* **Step 3: Build Your Key Facilities (Recommended Priority)**
  * Unlocking a Level 1 facility on a plot requires a small fee of **0.1 MON** (Monad's native token). We recommend unlocking them in this order:
    1. **üè¢ Exchange Lv1: Highest Priority!** It immediately increases your profit withdrawal rate from **70% to 80%**. This means for every 100 $CASH you earn, you get 10 more. This is crucial for a faster early-game payback.
    2. **üè≠ Factory Lv1: Second Priority.** It provides a **+10% output bonus**, directly increasing your gross profit.
    3. **üè¶ Bank Lv1: Can be deferred initially.** It unlocks a 6-hour production cycle instead of the default 2 hours. However, more frequent, shorter cycles can offer greater flexibility when your capital and staff are limited.
* **Step 4: Launch Your First "Shift"!**
  * Go to your Apartment's management interface, assign your recruited staff, pay the production cost (Wage), and initiate a 2-hour production cycle.
  * **Crucial:** Once the cycle completes, remember to **manually click "Claim"** to collect your rewards!
