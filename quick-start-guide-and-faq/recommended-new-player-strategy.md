# Recommended New Player Strategy

* **Cash Flow is King:** Always maintain enough $CASH in your wallet to cover the costs of at least your next production cycle. Avoid spending all your funds on upgrades at once, which could break your capital chain and halt operations.
* **Reinvest to Snowball:** Prioritize reinvesting every bit of profit you earn early on. The recommended priority remains:
  1. Upgrade your **Exchange to Lv3** (100% withdrawal rate).
  2. Upgrade your **Factory to Lv3** (+30% output bonus).
  3. Recruit **more staff** until they start "queuing" for available capacity on your land.
  4. **Upgrade your current land** or **purchase a second plot**.
  5. Upgrade the **Bank** to unlock longer, more "idle-friendly" shifts, reducing operational frequency.
* **Don't Ignore the Macro World:** Once you have idle $CASH, don't hesitateâ€”**stake** it immediately. This not only provides a stream of passive income but also allows you to participate in weekly votes, helping to create a "low-tax, high-productivity" paradise for your own operations.
