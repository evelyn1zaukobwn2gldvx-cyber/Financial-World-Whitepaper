# FAQ

* **Q: Can I sell my land?**
  * **A:** No. To ensure strategic depth, land is permanently bound to your account and cannot be traded. Every purchase is a deliberate business decision.
* **Q: What happens if I forget to claim my earnings?**
  * **A:** Your earnings remain safely stored in the contract until you claim them. However, we strongly recommend claiming them regularly, as only claimed $CASH can be reinvested to benefit from compound growth.
* **Q: Are the earnings fixed?**
  * **A:** No. Your earnings are dynamically influenced by both your own upgrade decisions (land, facilities) and the weekly district-wide parameters (productivity and tax rates) voted on by all players. This is a living economic world.
* **Q: The game seems complex. Can I actually win?**
  * **A:** _Financial World_ is fundamentally about mathematics and strategy, not luck or reflexes. The rules are transparent for everyone. If you are better at calculation and planning than others, you will succeed. Your calculator will be your greatest ally.
