# The Burn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Financial World Deflation Mechanism.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The value foundation of $CASH stems not from endless issuance, but from its continuous and irreversible burning within the game's ecosystem. We have designed two core "deflationary valves" that will constantly absorb the $CASH supply from the market, akin to black holes.

1. **Complete Burn of Production Costs (Wage Burn):**\
   This is the most powerful and stable source of deflation. **100% of the "Production Cost" (Wage)** paid to initiate every production shift is permanently burned by the smart contract and removed from the total supply.
   * **Implication:** The more active the game, the more players there are, and the larger the scale of production, the faster $CASH is burned.
2. **Permanent Removal of Efficiency Loss (Exchange Burn):**\
   In the early game, when your Exchange facility level is low, you cannot withdraw 100% of your generated profits. **The portion of profits that is "unwithdrawn" is also permanently burned by the smart contract.**
   * **Implication:** While this mechanism incentivizes players to upgrade their core facilities, it also forms another robust deflationary barrier, particularly during the early stages of the game.
