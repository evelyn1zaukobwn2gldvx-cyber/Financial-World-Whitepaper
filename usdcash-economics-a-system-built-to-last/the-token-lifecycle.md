# The Token Lifecycle

Within _Financial World_, $CASH follows a healthy, predictable lifecycle:

* **Issuance (Source):**
  * **Primary Source:** Net profits earned by players through production and operations.
  * **Incentive Source:** Passive rewards received from staking $CASH to participate in governance.
* **Sinks & Locks:**
  * **Hard Sinks (Permanent Burn):**
    * Production Costs (Wage)
    * Efficiency Loss (from low-level Exchange facilities)
    * 10% of every purchase amount in the IPO Round
  * **Soft Sinks (Reinvestment):**
    * Purchasing Land
    * Upgrading Facilities
    * Recruiting Staff
  * **Liquidity Lock (Temporarily Removed from Market):**
    * Staking for governance (7-day lock-up period)
    * Prize pool and dividend pool in the IPO Round

This closed-loop system ensures that $CASH is not merely "mined and dumped," but is continuously used, reinvested, locked, and burned within a feature-rich economy.
