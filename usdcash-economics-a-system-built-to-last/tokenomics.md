# Tokenomics

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Financial World Token Distribution.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* **Total Supply:** 100,000,000 $CASH (100 million tokens, fixed hard cap)
* **Initial Distribution Plan:**\
  We believe that the vast majority of value in a successful project should belong to the community that builds and participates in it. Here is our commitment:
  * The largest portion of tokens is allocated to **community rewards and in-game incentives**, directly rewarding players who actively participate in the ecosystem.
  * **Team and Advisor** allocations will be subject to a linear vesting schedule over several years, ensuring our interests are fully aligned with the project's long-term success.
  * Ample initial liquidity will be provided for **Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)** and will be locked for an extended period.
  * A **Public Sale** will offer the community an early participation opportunity, incorporating anti-whale mechanisms.

Note: Specific percentages and detailed vesting schedules will be provided in an upcoming, dedicated Tokenomics article.
