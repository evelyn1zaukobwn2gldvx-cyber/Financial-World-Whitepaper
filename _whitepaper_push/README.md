# FinanceWorld Whitepaper

Welcome to the FinanceWorld whitepaper. This site presents a clean, self‑contained overview of the on‑chain strategy sandbox we are building on the Monad blockchain.

Highlights
- Pure on‑chain, verifiable rules — code is law.
- Minimal core loop with deep strategy: Input → Production → Return.
- Built‑in deflation: 100% wage burn + un‑extracted profit burn.
- Player‑driven macroeconomy: weekly staking & governance.
- 24/7 IPO arena: high‑risk, high‑reward timing game.

Chapters
- [Chapter 1 · Welcome](book/chapter-1/README.md) — Vision, Core Loop, Differentiators, Glossary
- [Chapter 2 · Core Assets & Gameplay](book/chapter-2/README.md) — Land, Workers, Facilities, Yield Engine
- [Chapter 3 · Global Play (Governance & IPO)](book/chapter-3/README.md) — Weekly Voting, Staking, IPO Round
- [Chapter 4 · $CASH Token Economics](book/chapter-4/README.md) — Deflation, Lifecycle, Allocation
- [Chapter 5 · Quick Start Guide](book/chapter-5/README.md) — First Shift, Strategy, FAQ

Style & Conventions
- Monetary units: $CASH (18 decimals). Native token: MON (Monad).
- Figures use captions “Figure N — …” and are embedded near their referenced text.
- Headings use sentence‑style capitalization for clarity and consistency.

Notes & Disclaimers
- Lv1 facility unlock on Monad testnet uses 0.1 MON as a reference today. Mainnet value is parameterized/governed and may change. Frontends must always read `nativeUnlockPrice()` on‑chain (do not hard‑code).
- Contracts are the ultimate source of truth. If any discrepancy arises, on‑chain behavior prevails.

Feedback & Contributions
- Please open issues/PRs for clarifications, corrections, or suggestions.
