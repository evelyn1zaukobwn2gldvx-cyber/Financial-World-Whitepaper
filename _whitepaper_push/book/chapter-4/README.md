# FinanceWorld Whitepaper — Chapter 4 · $CASH Token Economics

## 4.0 Preface — Beyond “Play‑to‑Earn”
- Many crypto games spiral into early inflation and late collapse. FinanceWorld optimizes for sustainability with real, on‑chain sinks.

## 4.1 Core Value — Strong Built‑In Deflation
- Wage Burn (hard sink): 100% of prepaid wages are burned on every shift.
- Efficiency Burn (hard sink): Any un‑extracted profit (due to low Exchange level) is also 100% burned.
- The more activity, the more burn—supply declines with adoption.

## 4.2 Token Lifecycle — Source to Sinks
- Sources:
  - Operational net profit (from shifts)
  - Staking rewards (per‑second)
- Sinks & Locks:
  - Hard burns: Wages; un‑extracted profits; 10% of IPO buy‑ins
  - Reinvestment: Land purchases; facility upgrades; worker hiring
  - Temporary locks: Staking (7‑day lock); IPO pot/div pools

## 4.3 Allocation (Illustrative)
- Total Supply: 100,000,000 $CASH (fixed cap)
