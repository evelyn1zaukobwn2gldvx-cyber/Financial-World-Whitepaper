# The Three Facilities

Facilities are "exclusive enhancement modules" installed on each of your land plots. Their effects apply only to the land they are built on, allowing you to develop highly specialized production units.

**Unlock Rules:** Unlocking any Level 1 facility on a plot for the first time requires a small fee of 0.1 MON (testnet token; the official price will be announced after mainnet launch). Subsequent upgrades to Lv2/Lv3 only consume $CASH.
